# Memory Management Skill

Accept, categorise, store, recall, and prune personalised user context across sessions — projects, preferences, terminology, and working patterns — so every future conversation starts with the right knowledge. Context is held persistently through the CompanyGPT Memory feature and companyRAG collections.

## Where the Data Comes From

| Source | What It Adds |
| --- | --- |
| **CompanyGPT Memory** | Persistent store for personalised user context across sessions |
| **companyRAG collections** | Larger context documents, note collections, searchable knowledge |
| **MCP servers** (note tools, e.g. Notion, Obsidian) | Existing notes and context from connected systems |
| **File upload** | Context documents, glossaries, project notes you upload directly |

> **No connected source?** Provide the data in chat or upload the relevant files — the skill works the same way.

## Context Management Workflow

### Accept Context

When you provide context to remember, capture it precisely.

**Intake process:**

1. Receive the context — you state something to remember ("remember that Q3 planning uses the PACE framework" or "my team calls the onboarding project 'Lighthouse'")
2. Confirm understanding — paraphrase back to you to verify accuracy. Do not store misunderstood context.
3. Categorise — assign to the appropriate context category (see taxonomy below)
4. Acknowledge storage — confirm what was stored and in which category in CompanyGPT Memory

**Intake format:**

```
STORED CONTEXT:
  Category:   [category from taxonomy]
  Key:        [short identifier — e.g., "Q3 planning framework"]
  Value:      [the context itself — verbatim or accurately paraphrased]
  Added:      [date]
  Source:     [user-provided]
```

### Categorise

Organise stored context into these categories for efficient recall.

| Category | What Belongs Here | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Projects** | Active projects, codenames, timelines, stakeholders, status | "Project Lighthouse = onboarding redesign, launching Q3, led by Sarah" |
| **Preferences** | Working style, output format preferences, communication style | "Prefers bullet points over prose", "Uses British English spelling" |
| **Terminology** | Company-specific terms, acronyms, jargon, naming conventions | "PACE = Plan, Align, Create, Evaluate — our planning framework" |
| **Team** | Team members, roles, reporting lines, key contacts | "Direct reports: Alex (engineering), Maria (design), Tom (data)" |
| **Processes** | Recurring workflows, approval chains, standard operating procedures | "Budget requests go through Finance → VP → CFO for amounts over €50k" |
| **Tools & systems** | Preferred tools, system names, access patterns | "Uses Linear for task tracking, Notion for documentation" |
| **Constraints** | Boundaries, limitations, things to avoid | "Never use the term 'synergy' in deliverables — company culture thing" |

### Store

Storage principles:

- Atomic entries: Store each piece of context as a separate, self-contained entry. "My team uses Linear and prefers async communication" becomes two entries — one in Tools & systems, one in Preferences.
- Verbatim when possible: Use your own words. If paraphrasing for clarity, confirm with you.
- No interpretation: Store facts, not inferences. If you say "I work in Berlin," store that. Do not infer timezone, language preference, or employment law context.
- Timestamped: Every entry includes when it was added to enable staleness management.

### Recall

Use stored context proactively to improve assistance quality.

**Recall triggers:**

| Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- |
| You reference a stored project by name or codename | Apply stored project context automatically |
| Task involves a domain where preferences are stored | Apply formatting, style, and communication preferences |
| You mention a team member by name | Recall their role and relationship context |
| You use company-specific terminology | Use the stored definitions for accurate understanding |
| You ask "what do you know about me" or "what's in my context" | Present a structured summary of all stored context by category |

**Recall format when presenting stored context:**

```
# Your Stored Context

## Projects
  - [Key]: [Value] — added [date]
  - ...

## Preferences
  - [Key]: [Value] — added [date]
  - ...

## Terminology
  - [Key]: [Value] — added [date]
  - ...

[...continue for each category with entries]
```

### Prune Stale Items

Context goes stale. Regularly review and clean up stored entries.

**Staleness indicators:**

| Signal | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Project marked as completed or cancelled | Archive — move to inactive but retain for historical reference |
| Context contradicted by newer information | Update to current information; note the change |
| Entry older than 6 months with no recent recall | Flag for user review — "Is this still relevant?" |
| You explicitly say to forget something | Remove immediately |

**Pruning process:**

1. When context is recalled and seems potentially outdated, ask: "I have [context] stored from [date] — is this still current?"
2. Periodically (during weekly reviews or when you ask to review context), present entries older than 3 months for confirmation
3. When you provide updated context that conflicts with stored context, replace the old entry and confirm: "Updated [key] from [old value] to [new value]"

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Storing sensitive PII** | Privacy risk — passwords, personal financial data, health information, identity documents | REFUSE to store passwords, financial account details, health records, government ID numbers, or other sensitive personal data. Inform the user: "I cannot store this type of sensitive information." |
| **Inferring context** | Accuracy risk — assumptions may be wrong | Only store context you explicitly provide. Never infer preferences, relationships, or facts from conversation patterns. |
| **Storing third-party data** | Privacy and accuracy risk | Do not store detailed personal information about people other than basic professional context (name, role, team). Never store assessments, performance opinions, or personal details about third parties. |
| **Over-storing** | Noise overwhelms signal | Keep entries concise and atomic. If the context summary exceeds 30-40 entries, encourage the user to review and prune. |
| **Never pruning** | Stale context leads to wrong assumptions | Proactively flag stale entries for review rather than silently applying outdated context. |

## Guardrails

- NEVER fabricate or infer user context — all stored context must be explicitly provided by the user.
- NEVER store sensitive personal data (passwords, financial accounts, health information, government IDs).
- NEVER present recalled context as current fact without noting the storage date; prompt confirmation for entries older than 90 days.
- Flag outputs: `[From stored context]`, `[User-provided this session]`, `[Suggested]`.

> **Tip:** Ask for Markdown or DOCX output of your context summary via companyFILES to get a formatted, shareable overview.
