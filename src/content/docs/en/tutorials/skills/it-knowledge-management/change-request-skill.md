# Change Request Skill

Prepare IT change requests aligned with ITIL 4 change enablement — classification, risk analysis, implementation plans, rollback procedures, test plans, and communication plans. Change-specific details come from you, a connected MCP source, or companyRAG collections.

## Where the Data Comes From

| Source | What It Adds |
| --- | --- |
| **ITSM via MCP** (e.g. ServiceNow, Jira Service Management) | Change records, linked incidents, CAB schedules, affected configuration items |
| **Monitoring / CMDB via MCP** | Service dependencies, blast radius, active alerts, configuration-management data |
| **companyRAG / file upload** | Runbooks, approved standard-change procedures, architecture and reference documentation |

> **No connected source?** Provide the data in chat or upload the relevant files — the skill works the same way.

## Change Classification

Classify the change before writing the request. Classification determines the approval path, documentation depth, and lead time requirements.

### Change Types

| Type | Definition | Approval Path | Lead Time | Documentation Depth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard** | Pre-approved, low-risk, repeatable change with a documented procedure. Has been successfully executed before. | Pre-approved — no CAB review | Per procedure SLA | Reference to existing procedure |
| **Normal** | Planned change that requires assessment and approval. May be routine but is not pre-approved. | CAB or delegated approver | Organization-defined (typically 5+ business days) | Full change request |
| **Emergency** | Unplanned change required to restore service or prevent imminent failure. Cannot wait for normal approval cycle. | Emergency CAB (ECAB) or designated authority — retrospective full review | Immediate — approval during or after implementation | Abbreviated request, full post-implementation review |

### Classification Decision Tree

1. Is this a response to an active P1/P2 incident? → Emergency
2. Does an approved standard change procedure exist for this exact change? → Standard
3. Is this a routine, low-risk change that has been done successfully 3+ times with the same procedure? → Candidate for Standard (submit for pre-approval)
4. Everything else → Normal

### Standard Change Criteria

A change qualifies for Standard classification only when ALL of these are true:

- Documented, tested procedure exists and is current
- Risk is well-understood and consistently low
- Change has been executed successfully at least 3 times
- Rollback procedure is documented and tested
- No change to the change scope since the procedure was approved
- Approved by the CAB or change authority as a standard change

If ANY criterion is not met, classify as Normal regardless of how "simple" the change seems.

## Change Request Template

### Standard Change Request

```
# Standard Change Request

**Change ID**: [auto-generated or assigned]
**Date**: [date]
**Requestor**: [name, team]

## Change Description
**Standard change procedure**: [reference to approved procedure ID/name]
**What is being changed**: [specific instance — which server, service, or environment]
**Scheduled window**: [date and time]
**Estimated duration**: [time]

## Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Procedure [ID] is current (last reviewed: [date])
- [ ] All prerequisites from procedure are met
- [ ] Rollback procedure is ready
- [ ] Affected parties notified (if required by procedure)

## Implementation
Per procedure [ID]. No deviations.

```

### Normal Change Request

```
# Change Request: [CR-number]

**Date**: [date]
**Requestor**: [name, team]
**Change type**: Normal
**Priority**: [Critical / High / Medium / Low]
**Target date**: [requested implementation date]

## 1. Change Description

### What is being changed
[Precise description of the change. Specific enough that someone unfamiliar with the context can understand what will be different after the change.]

### Why this change is needed
[Business or technical justification. What problem does this solve? What happens if we don't make this change?]

### Scope
- **In scope**: [what this change covers]
- **Out of scope**: [what this change does NOT cover]
- **Systems affected**: [list of systems, services, or components]
- **Environments**: [production, staging, etc.]
- **Users affected**: [who will notice this change and how]

## 2. Risk Assessment

### Risk Classification

Evaluate each risk dimension:

| Dimension | Rating (H/M/L) | Justification |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Service impact** | [H/M/L] | [What breaks if this goes wrong?] |
| **User impact** | [H/M/L] | [How many users affected? Can they work around it?] |
| **Complexity** | [H/M/L] | [How many components, dependencies, or manual steps?] |
| **Reversibility** | [H/M/L] | [How easily can this be rolled back? Data loss risk?] |
| **Change window** | [H/M/L] | [Is the window sufficient? What happens if it overruns?] |
| **Dependency risk** | [H/M/L] | [Does this depend on other changes, teams, or vendors?] |

### Overall Risk Score

| Ratings | Overall Risk | Approval Level |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| All Low | Low | Team lead + change manager |
| Any Medium, no High | Medium | CAB review |
| Any High | High | CAB review + senior management |
| Multiple High or Critical service | Critical | CAB review + VP/CTO approval |

### Identified Risks

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | [what could go wrong] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [how to prevent or reduce] |
| 2 | [what could go wrong] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [how to prevent or reduce] |

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] [Prerequisite 1: e.g., backup completed and verified]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 2: e.g., monitoring dashboards open]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 3: e.g., rollback procedure reviewed by implementor]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 4: e.g., communication sent to affected parties]

### Implementation Steps

| Step | Action | Responsible | Estimated Time | Verification |
|------|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | [specific action] | [who] | [time] | [how to verify success] |
| 2 | [specific action] | [who] | [time] | [how to verify success] |
| 3 | [specific action] | [who] | [time] | [how to verify success] |

### Change Window
- **Start**: [date, time, timezone]
- **End**: [date, time, timezone]
- **Maintenance window required**: [Yes/No — will users experience downtime?]
- **Backup window**: [date, time — if the primary window is missed]

## 4. Test Plan

### Pre-Change Testing
[What testing was done before requesting this change? Test environment, test cases, results.]

| Test | Environment | Result | Date |

|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| [check] | [what success looks like] | [filled in during implementation] |

### Smoke Test Procedure
[Minimal set of checks to confirm basic functionality immediately after the change.]

1. [Check 1 — critical path verification]
2. [Check 2 — integration point verification]
3. [Check 3 — user-facing functionality verification]

## 5. Rollback Plan

### Rollback Decision Criteria
Initiate rollback if ANY of these conditions are met:
- [Criterion 1: e.g., post-change verification fails for any critical check]
- [Criterion 2: e.g., error rate exceeds X% within 30 minutes]
- [Criterion 3: e.g., change window is exceeded by more than 30 minutes]

### Rollback Procedure

| Step | Action | Responsible | Estimated Time |
|------|--------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | [rollback action] | [who] | [time] |
| 2 | [rollback action] | [who] | [time] |
| 3 | [verify rollback successful] | [who] | [time] |

### Rollback Limitations
[Any scenarios where rollback is not possible or is only partial. What happens to data created between deployment and rollback? Are there any irreversible steps?]

**Total estimated rollback time**: [time]
**Data impact of rollback**: [none / data loss risk described / manual intervention needed]

## Risk Assessment Deep Dive

### Service Dependency Analysis

Before assessing risk, map the change's blast radius:

1. Direct dependencies: Systems that directly consume or are consumed by the changed component
2. Indirect dependencies: Systems one hop removed — they depend on a system that depends on the changed component
3. Shared infrastructure: Load balancers, DNS, authentication services, databases that the changed component shares with other services

A "simple" change to a shared authentication service has a much larger blast radius than a change to an isolated microservice. The risk classification must reflect this.

### Change Conflict Detection

Check for conflicts with:

- Other changes scheduled in the same window
- Ongoing incidents that affect the same systems
- Freeze periods (code freezes, release moratoriums, regulatory audit windows)
- Major business events (end of quarter, product launches, peak traffic periods)

---

## Post-Implementation Review

Every change (including Standard changes) should have a lightweight post-implementation check. Normal and Emergency changes require a documented review.

### Review Checklist

- All post-change verifications passed
- No unexpected alerts triggered within the monitoring period
- No increase in error rates or support tickets
- Change documented in the configuration management database (CMDB) or equivalent
- Related documentation updated (runbooks, architecture docs, reference docs)
- Lessons learned captured (for non-trivial changes)

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Definition | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Change success rate** | Percentage of changes implemented without rollback or incident | Measures change quality |
| **Change lead time** | Time from request submission to implementation | Measures process efficiency |
| **Emergency change ratio** | Percentage of changes classified as Emergency | High ratio indicates process gaps or chronic underinvestment |
| **Failed change rate** | Percentage of changes that required rollback | Identifies systemic implementation issues |
| **Change-related incidents** | Incidents caused by changes within 48h of implementation | Measures change risk management effectiveness |

---

## Guardrails

- Never generate system-specific implementation steps from training data. All technical details come from the user or referenced runbooks. If critical steps are missing, ask.
- Never fabricate rollback procedures. Flag missing rollback plans as `[ROLLBACK PLAN REQUIRED]` rather than generating plausible-sounding steps.
- Never invent approval routing, CAB membership, or change windows. These are organisation-specific. Flag incomplete sections explicitly as blockers.
- Source-label all output: `[From change description]`, `[Change request template]`, or `[AI-structured — verify with change authority]`.
