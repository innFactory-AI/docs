# Sales Asset Skill

Produce deal-specific sales collateral — one-pagers, case study drafts, executive summaries, demo narratives, and proposal inserts — personalised to the buyer's industry, role, and stated priorities. All product information, case studies, pricing, and deal context comes from you, companyRAG collections, or a connected CRM.

## Where the Data Comes From

| Source | What It Adds |
| --- | --- |
| **CRM via MCP** (e.g. HubSpot, Salesforce) | Deal stage, deal value, stakeholders, competitive situation, closed-won notes |
| **companyRAG collections** | Product specs, case studies, proof points, industry references |
| **File upload** | Discovery notes, battlecards, account research, call summaries |

> **No connected source?** Provide the data in chat or upload the relevant files — the skill works the same way.

## Asset-Type Routing

Identify the right asset format based on the sales situation:

| Situation | Recommended Asset | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First meeting — leave-behind for champion | **One-Pager** | Concise overview the champion can forward internally |
| Executive sponsor engagement | **Executive Summary** | Business-outcome focused, minimal technical detail |
| Technical evaluation underway | **Solution Brief** | Architecture, integration, security, compliance focus |
| Prospect asked "who else uses this?" | **Case Study Draft** | Social proof mapped to their industry/use case |
| Demo scheduled — need a narrative arc | **Demo Narrative** | Storyline tying demo flow to their specific pain |
| Proposal or RFP response section | **Proposal Insert** | Tailored section addressing specific evaluation criteria |
| Multi-stakeholder deal — different needs | **Messaging Matrix** | Stakeholder-specific value props in one reference doc |

When the user's request does not clearly map to one type, ask clarifying questions about audience, timing, and intended use before drafting.

## Asset Creation Workflow

```
1. IDENTIFY asset type and audience
   |
   +--> Route to asset type (table above)
   +--> Identify primary audience: role, seniority, technical depth
   +--> Identify secondary audience: who else will see this?
   +--> Determine context: where in the deal cycle, what prompted the request
   |
2. GATHER deal context
   |
   +--> From CRM: deal stage, value, stakeholders, competitive situation
   +--> From user: specific pain points, evaluation criteria, buyer language
   +--> From companyRAG collections: product specs, case studies, proof points
   +--> From prior skills: account research, call summaries, battlecard intel
   |
3. MAP messaging to persona
   |
   +--> Apply the Persona-Message Matrix (see below)
   +--> Select value propositions ranked by relevance to this buyer
   +--> Choose proof points that match their industry and company size
   +--> Adapt language register to audience seniority and function
   |
4. GENERATE draft
   |
   +--> Apply the asset-specific template (see Asset Templates below)
   +--> Ensure every claim is backed by a source or flagged as needing one
   +--> Check against quality criteria before presenting
   |
5. REVIEW and refine
   |
   +--> Run the Asset Review Checklist (see below)
   +--> Flag sections that need user input or approval
   +--> Suggest alternative framings for key messages
```

## Persona-Message Matrix

Match messaging emphasis to the buyer's role and priorities:

| Persona | Primary Concerns | Message Emphasis | Proof-Point Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C-Suite / Executive** | Revenue impact, risk, strategic alignment | Business outcomes, ROI, competitive advantage | Revenue metrics, market position |
| **VP / Director** | Team productivity, budget justification | Operational efficiency, time-to-value, TCO | Productivity gains, cost savings |
| **Manager / Team Lead** | Day-to-day impact, adoption, workflow fit | Ease of use, integration, support quality | User satisfaction, adoption rates |
| **Technical Evaluator** | Architecture, security, scalability | Technical specs, compliance, API coverage | Technical benchmarks, certifications |
| **Procurement** | Cost, contract terms, vendor risk | Pricing transparency, vendor stability, SLAs | Financial health, customer count |
| **End User / Practitioner** | Daily workflow, learning curve, reliability | Usability, speed, reliability, support | User testimonials, ease-of-use metrics |

### Language Register by Seniority

| Audience Level | Register | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Executive** | Concise, outcome-first, strategic framing, minimal jargon | Feature lists, technical specifications, acronyms |
| **Management** | Balanced — outcomes with supporting detail, metric-driven | Vague claims without numbers, excessive length |
| **Practitioner** | Specific, practical, workflow-oriented, technically precise | High-level platitudes, marketing superlatives |

## Asset Review Checklist

Before delivering any asset, verify:

| Criterion | Check |
| --- | --- |
| **Audience alignment** | Does the language, depth, and emphasis match the intended reader? |
| **Claim substantiation** | Is every claim backed by a sourced proof point or flagged? |
| **Prospect specificity** | Could this asset only apply to this prospect, or is it generic? |
| **Competitive awareness** | Does it address known alternatives without naming competitors negatively? |
| **CTA appropriateness** | Is the call-to-action matched to the deal stage? |
| **Length appropriateness** | One-pager: 1 page. Exec summary: 1-2 pages. Case study: 1-2 pages. |
| **Brand consistency** | Does it match the customer's brand voice guidelines (if provided)? |
| **Formatting** | Professional, clean, no markdown artifacts in customer-facing copy |
| **Legal/compliance** | No unapproved claims, accurate case study data, no NDA violations |

## Guardrails

1. Never fabricate case studies or customer quotes. All customer names, results, and testimonials must come from the user or companyRAG collections. Use "[Insert customer reference for this industry]" when none are provided.
2. Never generate product capabilities not provided by the user. If product details are not in companyRAG collections or user input, flag as "[Verify with product team]" rather than assuming features.
3. Never invent metrics or ROI figures. Business-impact projections must be based on provided case data or flagged as "[Placeholder — needs validation with customer success team]".
4. Source labeling. Tag content origin — [From companyRAG collection], [From user input], [From CRM], [From deal context], [AI draft — verify].

> **Tip:** Ask for PPTX output via companyFILES to get a formatted slide deck, or DOCX for a one-pager ready for distribution. PDF and Markdown are also available for longer collateral.
